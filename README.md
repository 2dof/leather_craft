## To calculate lace length neeeded for belt: 
"Take the person's waist measurement and multiply it by 3.The scale below gives the person's waist measurement , the number
of strands to cut and the length of the strands" (from page 16 of BUSH LEATHERWORK by RON EDWARDS)

## To calculate how long lease you can cut-put from given leather (square shape ) size:

1. Open calc file. define leather square size, define middle cut-out radius part and  lace width. Read calculated length S.

Or calculate from table:
<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/2dof/leather_craft/blob/main/table_1.png" width="1200" height="200" />

for example like that:
1. desired lace width  w = 3  mm
2. given leather square size  b= 120 mm
3.  read value from table for given w and b :  S1= 377 cm
4.  We cut out from the inside  to outside of leather, so we need cut out some circular hole (waste), let say , diameter b0 = 20 mm .
   so for w = 3 and b=20 we reas S0 = 11 cm
5.  total length of the cut strip: S = S1 - S0 = 377 - 11 = 366 cm

Note: in reality we cut-out a litle shorter strap  since at the end of cutting (close to the edge) lather can wrinkle, or we can cut 
out circular hole  not in exact in the middle - so take into account.
